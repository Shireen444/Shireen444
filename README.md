- Currently sharpening my data science acumen at upGrad.com's BootCamp, I am a Master of Science in Mathematics from Christ University with a solid foundation in analytical thinking. As a Technical Support Associate at Amazon, my daily mission involves addressing the technical concerns of a global customer base, leveraging my strong communication skills to deliver exceptional service.

Our team at Amazon thrives on collaboration, and I contribute to this dynamic by streamlining customer support processes and educating users on policy compliance. These initiatives have been instrumental in maintaining high satisfaction rates and fostering a culture of integrity.
